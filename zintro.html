  <h3> Hey there! My name is Zamina and I'm from Rahway, New Jersey. I am a graduating Information Technology major with a concentration in Web and Digital Media and a minor in Computer Science. This school year, I was the vice president for the Women in Tech club on the NYC campus. I was originally a Computer Science major, but I decided to change because I preferred learning about hardware more than software. I love to play The Sims and watch Rupaul's Drag Race (mostly any competition reality TV show, really). I also love tp create and make things; anything from paitings to rugs to digital collages. </h3>
