  <h3> Hello! My name is Julie, my pronouns are she/her. I graduated from Pace with a BS in CS in 2015, and an MS in CS in 2017. I have been a web developer and teaching web development
  since 2012. I learned how to do web development so that I could create software that my friends could use and as a way to express my creativity. I love coding because it enables
  me to create things without having to pay for materials. I now work as a Community Game Designer at <a href="https://hackclub.com">Hack Club</a>, a non-profit that encourages
  high schoolers to learn how to code and start coding clubs at their schools. My job is a combination of community management, creating magical experiences, and doing some software engineering
  to create better tools for our community. I previously worked as a software engineer at Dom and Tom in New York City, as a software engineer at Plex, and as the Director of Technology Business Development
  at AngelHack. I love hackathons and experimenting with new technology! </h3>
