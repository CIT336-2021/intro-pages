  <h3> Hello Everyone! My name is Razib, I'm from Brooklyn, New York. I am currently an Information Technology major because I love technology overall. I love fixing/building 
  anything related to it such as computers and phones. Originally I used to be a Computer Science major but I ended up switching because I don't like coding as much and 
  I'm more towards the hardware side of things. I am currently a Junior at PACE and love to play video games and spend time with family. I do make music on the side. This is 
  because it's therapeutic for me. Currently, I have a few songs out on all streaming platforms and my artist name is OBI which is also my nickname (Obby). </h3>
