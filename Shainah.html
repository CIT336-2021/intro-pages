  <h1>Shainah Kleeman</h1>
  <h3>Hi my name is Shainah! I am from Long Island, New York. I am a senior here at Pace University majoring in Business Management and double minoring in Law and Computer Information Technology (CIT). I am looking forward to my last semester here at Pace as I am anticipating graduation in May 2021. I found interest in coding after taking a course my freshman year and have enjoyed learning it over these past four years. I look forward to learning more in this course and expanding my knowledge on Computer Information Technology.</h3>
