        <p class="about-me">
            Hey there! My name's Andy. I'm a senior IT major. I've been studying web development since I was 12. I worked in insurance after
            graduating high school, but decided to return to school and pursue my true passion. My first few websites were actually MySpace
            layouts. As I got older, I dove deeper into the world of JavaScript and explored the back-end with Ruby on Rails and Express.js.
            Some of my favorite technologies are...

        <ul class="favorites-list">
            <li class="favorites-item">
                React
            </li>
            <li class="favorites-item">
                Node.js (try it out! it's fun)
            </li>
            <li class="favorites-item">
                Django
            </li>
            <li class="favorites-item">
                SCSS
            </li>
